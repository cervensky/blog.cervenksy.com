				<h1>The Penguin's Reign</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					<i>
						You're currently (probably) in Windows City. You can have many great adventures in there, like playing a game, editing photos and videos, writing a letter on your favorite word processing program or doing stuff on the Internet. And that's great and fun, but sometimes you see a person walking into a subway station and waiting for a train. That person usually takes the train to a place called "The Penguin's Reign". You wonder how it is like there, outside of Windows City. Thus, one day you decide to also take that train and take a look at that foreign place. Once you arrive, you only see darkness. How is that person able to navigate and what is he even doing in there all the time? <br>
						You take the train back home, but you now are even more curious about that weird place and the person regularly going there. You ask around a bit and people throw words at you like "web server", "network security", "moonbuggy", "android". You have no idea what they're talking about and now went to this self-made website of that Cervensky dude, which will make things clear, hopefully.
